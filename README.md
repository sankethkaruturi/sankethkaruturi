* *Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)*
* *XGBoost*
* *Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)*

üî≠ Below are some state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series forecasting models used in various real-time projects: 

* *Auto-Regressive (AR) Model*
* *Auto-Regressive Moving Averages (ARMA) Model*
* *Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) Model*
* *Vector AutoRegression (VAR)*
* *Neural Hierarchical Interpolation of Time Series (N-HiTS) Model*
* *Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) Model*
* *Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT)*

üî≠ Furthermore, below are some of the tools used during my experience for __Generative AI__:

* *Langchain*
* *LangGraph*
* *Llama Index*
* *Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)*
* *OpenAI API (ChatGPT, Whisper, DALL¬∑E, etc.)*
* *HuggingFace Transformers*
* *Mixtral (LLM)*
* *LLaMA 2 / LLaMA 3 (Meta AI)*
* *GPT-4.5 / GPT-4o / GPT-o1*
* *Claude Opus 4*

Given below are some of the repositories that I have added that I felt had key ingredients in them that helped me excel in this data science journey. 

üìΩ [__Jose Portilla's Reinforcement Learning Course__]() - One of the interesting things about the instructor [Jose Portilla](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/) is his attention to detail and clarity of explanation.

## üî¨üßê My Thoughts on State-of-the-art (SOTA) Techniques in Artificial Intelligence

<img src = "https://github.com/sankethkaruturi/Images/blob/17ccddf951df208fcce19a038a6d2ad5878acae5/Project%20Thumbnails/animation%20illustration%20GIF%20by%20Tony%20Babel.gif" width = "750"/>

There is a large volume of research taking place in the field of machine learning and data science. There are newer and computationally efficient algorithms being developed by the likes of many companies and research institutes. I would like to share my thoughts on these latest machine learning trends and explain them well. 

&emsp;&emsp; üëÄüëÅ [__Vision Transformers (ViTs)__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_transformer) - Transformers have revolutionized the __natural language processing industry (NLP)__ where a given text is converted into a representation that takes into account the contextual information for all the possible words given as input and returns a vector with these weights and other dependencies. One interesting research area that has emerged is to use of these same transformers for computer vision tasks. __Convolutional Neural Networks__, CNNs for short, are currently being used to take into account different positions of the image and map them with their weights before making predictions. But if we could represent these vectors by using contextual dependencies, then vision transformers might be able to replace CNNs in the future. Currently, as the performance of vision transformers has not been significantly higher than the CNN models, there is no replacement for CNNs. However, as the complexity of vision transformers increases, there is a possibility that they might replace CNNs for image processing tasks.

&emsp;&emsp; üì£üîä [__LIME &__](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~marcotcr/blog/lime/) [__SHAP (Explainable AI)__](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_notebooks/overviews/An%20introduction%20to%20explainable%20AI%20with%20Shapley%20values.html) - __LIME__ stands for __Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations__ while __SHAP__ stands for __Shapley Additive Explanations__. One of the challenges with using AI and machine learning, in general, is their lack of interpretability. Though there are models such as Random Forests and Decision trees that explain why they have come up with a particular outcome such as giving feature importance, they fail to account for local dependencies which means they do not give output for a particular query point but only provide explainability in terms of the entire dataset. Furthermore, there are other models that do not also offer these features. With the help of LIME and SHAP, it is possible to explain for a query point why a particular outcome is generated for any of the machine learning models at hand. Therefore, LIME and SHAP are good, and executing them is also a lot easier with the help of libraries.

&emsp;&emsp; üìïüìö [__BERT &__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) [__RoBERTa__](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/roberta-an-optimized-method-for-pretraining-self-supervised-nlp-systems/) - __BERT__ stands for __Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers__ while __RoBERTa__ stands for __Robustly Optimized BERT Pre-training Approach__. These models have been gaining popularity due to their extremely good performance in natural language processing tasks. They are basically transformers with bidirectional context vector representation. In other words, they take into account the context in terms of both the forward pass and the backward pass as well. This works extremely well due to the fact that representing each word based on the context of all the words in the document is basically a good way to understand human language. 

&emsp;&emsp; üîéüî¶ [__FAISS &__](https://ai.facebook.com/tools/faiss/) [__ScaNN__](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/announcing-scann-efficient-vector.html) - When we are dealing with finding similar rows in our data and we have a very high dimensional representation of a vector, with traditional algorithms it takes a long time to find similarly if we use metrics such as __euclidean distance__ and __cosine similarity__. __Facebook Research__ has launched __FAISS__ that simplifies the process of searching for similarity and clustering of dense vectors. In the same light, __Google AI Research__ came up with __ScaNN__ which speeds up the overall process of computing the distance between various features and reduces the time complexity to a large extent. The outputs from these models contain vectors that represent a large amount of information from the input data. These are useful for building __good recommender systems__ where the items that are the most similar are recommended to a user along with many other applications as well.

&emsp;&emsp; üéßüîâ [__Audio Signal as a Spectrogram__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrogram#:~:text=A%20spectrogram%20is%20a%20visual,may%20be%20called%20waterfall%20displays.) - We can define our audio signal in terms of a __spectrogram__ which is used in __audio processing__. One of the most insightful things that are currently done for deep learning is that an audio signal is converted to a spectrogram image which is later used with __convolutional neural networks (CNNs)__ for NLP tasks. Therefore, we are trying to pose the audio problem as a computer vision problem and get __higher accuracy__ and __better results__. __CNNs__ are known to perform especially well if we are able to give large amounts of image data. CNN along with transfer learning produces extremely good results. Therefore, it is improving the performance of NLP tasks such as __speech detection__ and many others. 

&emsp;&emsp; ü§ùüï∏  [__Siamese Networks__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_neural_network) - Building __recommender systems__ whether it be __recommending items__, __movies__, or __songs__ with the help of deep neural networks can be a hard problem to define and solve respectively. With the help of __Siamese neural networks__, it is possible to use deep learning for recommending users various items as discussed above. __Siamese networks__ essentially take into account __2 different inputs__ and they have __2 networks__ that accept these inputs. The same weights are initialized to both networks and the __outputs__ from these two networks are combined together to get our predictions of how likely is the user going to like a particular item. Furthermore, it is also possible to perform __one-shot learning__ with these models which means that with few training examples, the model would learn to perform the best for the task at hand.


## üé¨üîö Summary

These are some of my __projects__, __blogs__ and __certifications__ that I have worked on and uploaded on __GitHub__. I would be looking forward to learning new technologies in the field of __AI__ and __machine learning__ by going through a few more courses and applying my knowledge to different projects. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need any explanations of the projects. Looking forward to sharing my knowledge with the community.
