<h2> üë®‚Äçüéìüôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me üíºüéí: </h2>

I earned my Masters Degree in Computer Science at [__Oregon State University__](https://oregonstate.edu/).

I bring 3+ years of hands-on experience in designing, training, and deploying __machine learning__ and __deep learning models__.

In addition, I have a solid foundation‚Äîboth theoretical and practical‚Äîin developing and deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) and working on Generative AI projects.

üî≠ Below are some of the companies I have worked:

* *Discovery Analytics Inc, Atlanta, Georgia, USA*
* *Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, USA*
* *Pentachrome Technologies Pvt Ltd, Bengaluru, Karnataka, India*
* *AEQUS Aerospace, Belagavi, Karnataka, India*

üî≠ Some of the notable courses I have completed and that helped in gaining strong theoretical foundation include: 
* *Machine Learning Certification by [__Stanford University__](https://www.stanford.edu/)*
* *Deep Learning Specialization by [__Andrew Ng__](https://www.andrewng.org/)*
* *Deploying AI & Machine Learning Models for Business from [__Udemy__](https://www.udemy.com/)*
* *Python for Time Series Data Analysis by [__Jose Portilla__](https://www.udemy.com/user/joseportilla/)*

üî≠ I've used different Machine Learning and Deep Learning models in real-time projects. Below are some used models:

* *Linear Regression*
* *Logistic Regression*
* *Support Vector Machines (SVM)*
* *Decision Trees (DT)*
* *Random Forests (RF)*
* *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)*

* *Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)*
* *Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)*
* *Naive Bayes (NB)*
* *Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)*
* *XGBoost*
* *Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)*

üî≠ Below are some state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series forecasting models used in various real-time projects: 

* *Auto-Regressive (AR) Model*
* *Auto-Regressive Moving Averages (ARMA) Model*
* *Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) Model*
* *Vector AutoRegression (VAR)*
* *Neural Hierarchical Interpolation of Time Series (N-HiTS) Model*
* *Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Averages (SARIMA) Model*
* *Temporal Fusion Transformers (TFT)*

üî≠ Furthermore, below are some of the tools used during my experience for __Generative AI__:

* *Langchain*
* *LangGraph*
* *Llama Index*
* *Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)*
* *OpenAI API (ChatGPT, Whisper, DALL¬∑E, etc.)*
* *HuggingFace Transformers*
* *Mixtral (LLM)*
* *LLaMA 2 / LLaMA 3 (Meta AI)*
* *GPT-4.5 / GPT-4o / GPT-o1*
* *Claude Opus 4*
* *Gemini (Google DeepMind)*

üî≠ Here are some of the skillsets in regards to __DevOps__ technologies:

* *Docker*
* *Docker-Compose*
* *Kubernetes*
* *Linux*
* *Jenkins*
* *Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)*
* *Travis CI*
* *Ubuntu*

__Natural Language Processing (NLP)__ is converting a natural text into a form that could be used for machine learning and deep learning purposes. It involves extracting texts, removing stopwords, lemmatization and stemming, lowercasing the letters, and removing punctuations and other text information that do not add a lot of meaning in our machine learning predictions. Below are the links to some of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects.

üìö [__Predicting Readability of Texts Using Machine Learning__]   

* Text mining, data visualization, and machine learning can reveal useful insights in the vast amount of text that surrounds us, making it more actionable and useful.
* In addition to this, understanding the difficulty of the text and whether it is at our level could give us good knowledge about the depth of the article.
* Moreover, __libraries__ and other educational institutions could use this information and classify textbooks and notebooks, and separate them based on the difficulty level.
* In this project, machine learning and deep learning algorithms were used to predict the difficulty of texts.
* __Hyperparameter tuning__ was also done to ensure that the models took important features into consideration and made predictions with low __mean squared error__ and __mean absolute error__ respectively.

## üëÄüëÅ My Computer Vision Projects

<img  src = "https://github.com/sankethkaruturi/Images/blob/592b8288d3ac30726f2fff1ee70844e8616720dc/download%20(2).gif" width = "750" />

__Computer Vision__ is a subset of artificial intelligence which gives the computer to perform computations and make predictions on image data. If the image of a cat is given, for instance, the computer vision algorithms would classify whether there is a cat in the image based on a previously labeled set of images. Therefore, it is important to give the right data to the computer vision algorithms in order for them to get the right predictions. 

Computer vision offers immense potential and high demand due to its wide range of applications. The abundance of image and video data creates numerous opportunities for leveraging computer vision tools effectively. Here, I present a selection of intriguing projects I have personally undertaken in the field of computer vision.

üéã [__Wheat Disease Detection Using Transfer Learning__]

* __Wheat__ is commonly available in various forms such as cereals and bread, but it is susceptible to diseases during production.
* Manual identification of wheat diseases is time-consuming for farmers.
* Computer Vision can be utilized to understand and identify different diseases in wheat, leading to significant time savings.
* This technology enables prompt identification of diseases and facilitates preventive measures for future occurrences.
* Several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) like InceptionV3, Xception, and VGG19 were tested to detect wheat diseases.
* VGG19 exhibited exceptional performance, achieving a test accuracy of 97 percent.
